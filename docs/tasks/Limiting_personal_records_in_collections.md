Limiting personal records in collections
===

By default, users can add personal records to any collection for which
they have read access.  This can be problematic if a collection is
supposed to be authoritative.

To disallow the addition of personal records to a collection, add the
following restriction to the permissions on the collection for the
relevant users or groups:

    personal=no
